Currently, I am interested in computer architecture and analog/RFIC design and am actively trying to build cool projects in these areas.&#xA;When I&amp;rsquo;m not working, I&amp;rsquo;m usually speed cubing my way to a new personal best. I&amp;rsquo;m also currently learning to solve the Rubik&amp;rsquo;s cube blindfolded and making steady progress (like, seriously, who needs to see?</description>

      <description>Projects Link to heading the below are some of the projects i&amp;rsquo;ve built as a part of courses i had taken at university and hackathons i was a part of.&#xA;Router Placement (Python, Flutter) Link to heading GitHub Repository&#xA;This project aims to determine the most efficient placement of routers in a given area to ensure optimal Wi-Fi coverage. The algorithm takes into account factors such as signal strength, interference, and user density to recommend the best placement for the routers.</description>
