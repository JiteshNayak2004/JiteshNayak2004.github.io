# Projects

the below are some of the projects i've built as a part of courses i had taken at university and hackathons i was a part of.

### Router Placement (Python, Flutter)
[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/JiteshNayak2004/router_placement)

This project aims to determine the most efficient placement of routers in a given area to ensure optimal Wi-Fi coverage. The algorithm takes into account factors such as signal strength, interference, and user density to recommend the best placement for the routers.

### Dadda Multiplier (Verilog, OpenLane)
[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/JiteshNayak2004/pes_dadda_multiplier)

Complete RTL to GDS implementation of a fast and efficient Dadda multiplier using the OpenLane tool flow.

### Deep Detect (TensorFlow, Python)
[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/JiteshNayak2004/deep-detect)

A deepfake detector using CNN and LSTM architecture.

### Bandgap Circuit Design (Virtuoso Schematic Editor)
Designed a bandgap circuit along with a startup circuit for a reference voltage of 1.2 volts and VDD ranging from 2.4-3.3 volts in 180nm CMOS process.

### Two stage op amp design (Virtuoso Schematic Editor)
Designed a 2-stage OpAmp: vdd=1.8V, 1000x dc gain, power 300mW, >60Â° PM, 0.8-1.6V CMR, stable 2pF load.
